I have really enjoyed working with both the Challenges!

I have mainly coded both the Challenges in C#. Since I had extra time I coded Challenge 1 in java as well.

I have used visual studio to execute both java and C# code and there is no compile error.

I have calculated spread_to_benchmark for C1 is C1.yield - G1.yield using the formula give and it prints the same output.

for Challenge2 I have calculated spread_to_curve using linear interpolation.

C1.spread_to_curve = A - B
C2.spread_to_curve = X - Y

I have tested the code and added breakpoints where I felt the code was giving errors, and finally concluded to the final code.
